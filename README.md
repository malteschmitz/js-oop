JavaScript and object oriented programming.

This repository contains code sniplets about object oriented programming
in JavaScript:
* use prototypical inheritance (also called delegation or
  differential inheritance) directly
* simulate classical inheritance (using classes and instances of these)

Maybe this will some time evolve into a talk.
